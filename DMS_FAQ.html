                    answer: "The NIH Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy, effective January 25, 2023 (<a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline\" target=\"_blank\">NOT-OD-21-013</a>), requires researchers to plan for and share scientific data from NIH-funded projects. The policy aims to accelerate biomedical discoveries by increasing data transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility for the research community and the public. It applies to all research that generates scientific data, regardless of the funding mechanism."

Specifically, under the 2023 DMS Policy (<a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html\" class=\"text-sm text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline\" target=\"_blank\">NOT-OD-21-013</a>), scientific data must be shared by the earlier of these <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/sharing-policies/dms/data-sharing-approaches#:~:text=Timeliness%20of%20Data%20Sharing\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline\" target=\"_blank\">two timepoints</a>:

                        <p class="mt-2">Researchers should also be aware that some preprint servers or data repositories may require earlier public release of data upon preprint posting.

Investigators, their institutions, and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are responsible for safeguarding participant rights and data confidentiality. Key considerations and strategies include:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mt-2">
                            <li><b>Informed Consent:</b> Discussions about data sharing, potential risks, and mitigation strategies should be an integral part of the informed consent process with research participants. Promises not to share data should be made sparingly and with adequate justification.</li>
                            <li><b>De-identification:</b> Prior to sharing, direct and indirect identifiers must be removed from the data. Researchers should be particularly cautious with data from small geographic areas, rare populations, or linked datasets where re-identification risks are higher.</li>
                            <li><b>Minimizing Disclosure Risks:</b> Adopt strategies to prevent unauthorized disclosure, potentially by statistically altering data in ways that protect identities without compromising secondary analyses, or by withholding parts of the data.</li>
                            <li><b>Controlled Access:</b> For datasets that cannot be broadly distributed due to privacy, security, or other reasons, sharing through controlled-access repositories (data enclaves) or systems that restrict access to eligible researchers is an appropriate approach.</li>
                            <li><b>Data Use Agreements:</b> For data shared under the auspices of the investigator or through controlled access, data use agreements should include conditions for protecting confidentiality, privacy, and prohibiting attempts at re-identification.</li>
                            <li><b>Clinical Trials and HIPAA:</b> Investigators conducting clinical trials must carefully assess privacy risks related to study design and data collection, describing these and mitigation approaches in the informed consent. Those subject to HIPAA must comply with its Privacy Rule requirements for Protected Health Information.</li>

                    question: "What specific expectations do individual NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) have for genomic data sharing, and why is this important?",
                    answer: `While the overarching NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy provides a general framework, individual NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) may have additional, specific expectations or requirements for projects generating large-scale genomic data. These IC-specific expectations can cover various aspects, including:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mt-2">
                            <li><b>Policy Applicability:</b> Some ICs, like NHGRI or NIDCR, may apply the GDS Policy more broadly (e.g., to all human genetics/genomics studies regardless of participant number, or to specific rare diseases/populations).</li>
                            <li><b>Informed Consent:</b> While NIH generally expects informed consent for broad sharing for specimens collected after January 25, 2015, some ICs like NHGRI require explicit consent regardless of collection date, or an approved exception. Others may have specific points to consider in consent for sensitive areas (e.g., NIMH).</li>
                            <li><b>Sharing Plan Requirements:</b> Some ICs may have their own GDS plan templates or require additional details in the harmonized DMS Plan (e.g., NHLBI, NHGRI, NIDA's expectation for DOIs and Resource Identifiers).</li>
                            <li><b>Data Submission & Release:</b> While general timelines exist, some ICs have specific repository preferences or requirements for certain data types (e.g., NIA expects biological and phenotypic data at NCRAD and genomic data at NIAGADS; NIMH expects data at the NIMH Data Archive (NDA)). NIDCD expects all genomic/transcriptomic data deposited in a public database at publication.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-2">It is crucial for investigators to consult with a Program Officer (extramural) or Scientific Director (intramural) from their funding IC early in the planning process to understand all applicable requirements. This ensures that their Data Management and Sharing Plan (which now integrates GDS considerations) aligns with both the general NIH policies and any specific IC-level mandates, thereby facilitating compliance and successful funding.</p>`
